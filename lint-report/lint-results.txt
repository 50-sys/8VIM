Lint errors can be suppressed in a variety of ways:<br/>
 and To suppress a lint warning with an annotation, add a <code>@SuppressLint("id")</code> annotation on the class, method or variable declaration closest to the warning instance you want to disable. The id can be one or more issue id's, such as <code>"UnusedResources"</code> or <code>{"UnusedResources","UnusedIds"}</code>, or it can be <code>"all"</code> to suppress all lint warnings in the given scope.<br/>
