# 8Vim
The application is essentially a clone for 8pen, which for some reason they have stopped distributing. ( I can no longer install it even though when i paid for it!!!)

To understand what exactly this keyboard is please watch the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vsUF4NuLk"

Now I will go ahead and shamlessly copy text from the original 8Pen website.

##Handwriting reinvented
The 8vim draws inspiration from handwriting. By mimicking the way our hand moves when constrained to a square canvas, we are able to create a natural and fun writing experience, akin to doodling on a piece of paper.

##Designed for speed
The layout is optimised for fast writing, by allowing for the most common letter sequences to be produced with swift, fluid gestures. Once familiar with the layout, you can reach speeds of 40 words per minute.
