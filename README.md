# 8Vim
The application is essentially a clone for 8pen, which for some reason they have stopped distributing. ( I can no longer install it even though when i paid for it!!!)

To understand what exactly this keyboard is please watch the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vsUF4NuLk"

Now I will go ahead and shamlessly copy text from the original 8Pen website.

######Handwriting reinvented
The 8vim draws inspiration from handwriting. By mimicking the way our hand moves when constrained to a square canvas, we are able to create a natural and fun writing experience, akin to doodling on a piece of paper.

######Designed for speed
The layout is optimised for fast writing, by allowing for the most common letter sequences to be produced with swift, fluid gestures. Once familiar with the layout, you can reach speeds of 40 words per minute.


#Usability Guide

Let me start by declaring - **"The UI for the keyboard is SHIT!"**

Yeah yeah I know, I know. Can't help it. it is what it is. I am bad at UI. end of story.

So, with that out of the way, what capablities does 8Vim have?

Once you know how to type with this thing (Learn how to type with this original [8Pen-game App] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eightpen.android.wordcup&hl=en), you must know the following 

#####Basic Needed Stuff

- Right Sector acts as a backspace Key.
- Bottom Sector acts as a Enter Key.
- Top Sector acts as a combi of SHIFT and CAPS_LOCK Key, i.e, Press once Shift is active, Press Twice CAPS is active and Press once more and everything is back to usual.
- Left Sector acts as the button that takes you to the Number Pad.


#####Cursor Movements 
If you move your finger from the centre-circle to any sector and stay, the cursor movement will be emulated. For example, if you swipe from circle->right, the cursor will move right. You get the picture.

#####Selection
There is selection built in to the keyboard. if you move your finger from the right sector to the circle, the cursor will start moving left and selecting everything in it's path. once you release, a selection keyboard will open up for various stupidities to do.

#####Paste Functionality
Moving your finger from right->circle->lift-your-finger performs a paste. whatever is in the clipboard.
